											<h3>Football is ...</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Football is a sport where the goal is to literally score in the opposition's goal, made of some posts and a net. There are 11 players on each side of the match. There is usually a goalkeeper who protects the goal and can use their hands, and this is very useful as any other player can only use their feet in the match. There are then some defenders, some midfielders, and some attackers. There are two linesmen, a referee, two commentators, and VAR. These are all the basic knowledge of football that you will need to know when looking at this website.</p>

											<h3>Worldwide Football Events</h3>
										</header>
										        <p>
											<B>World Cup-</B>This is a huge football event that happens every 4 years, the last one being in 2022 in Qatar.It is to decide which country out of the 32 countries come out victorious. The qualification table is standard and is like any other ordinary table. Players from each team represent their own country and would try their best to make their country proud.
											</p>
											<p>
										        <B>THE FA CUP-</B> The Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in men's domestic English football. As the oldest national football competition in the world,it is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA). The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, and are contested by clubs in the National League System, levels 5 to 10 of the English football system; 32 of these teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues I and II. The last entrants are the 20 Premier League and 24 Championship clubs, into the draw for the third round proper. In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final. Winners receive the FA Cup trophy,and also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles, but Manchester City are the current holders.

										        <B>THE EUROS-</B>The Euros is very similar to the World Cup but, from its name, only countries in Europe participate in it and it also takes place every four years.
Did you know that only four teams participated in the first European Championship in 1960?

											<h3>How to Play Football</h3>
											<p>Elementary fundamentals and rules to playing football</p>
										</header>
										<p>

There are some interesting rules implemented in this beautiful game. Firstly, fouls are quite similar to other sports:a player is given a foul when he has been hurt on purpose other through a rough or bad tackle, such as some slide tackles, or they have been insulted verbally. A slightly harmful tackle on purpose could result in a yellow card and either getting two yellow cards or doing a very gruesome tackle against an oppositional player could result in a red card, which sends the player off and gives them a fine depending on the league the game is played in as lower leagues will give lower fines of around £30 for a red card and around £10 for a yellow card. Having repeated red cards for consistently for at least 3 matches in a row can result in being banned from playing for some weeks. If something is extremely serious, like breaking another player's body, it could result in a year long ban or even longer. Another interesting rule is offsides. These happen when a player is behind the opposition defenders and has received the ball from another player. The referee  will call offside and the opposition will get a free kick.A throw-in is awarded to the opponents of the player who last touched the ball when the whole of the ball passes over the touchline, on the ground or in the air. There are also throw ins:

  <ol>
     A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in:
     <li>if the ball enters the opponents’ goal – a goal kick is awarded</li>
     <li>if the ball enters the thrower’s goal – a corner kick is awarded</li>
  </ol>

<p>
<B>Procedure</B>

  <ol>
     At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower must:
     <li>stand facing the field of play;</li>
     <li>have part of each foot on the touchline or on the ground outside the touchline;</li>
     <li>throw the ball with both hands from behind and over the head from the point where it left the field of play;</li>
     <li>All opponents must stand at least 2 m (2 yds) from the point on the touchline where the throw-in is to be taken;</li>
     <li>The ball is in play when it enters the field of play. If the ball touches the ground before entering, the throw-in is retaken by the same team from the same position. If the throw-in is not taken correctly it is retaken by the opposing team.</li>
  </ol>

</p>

<p>
If a player, while correctly taking a throw-in, deliberately throws the ball at an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or a reckless manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.The thrower must not touch the ball again until it has touched another player.
</p>

<B>Offences and sanctions</B>
  <ol>
     If, after the ball is in play, the thrower touches the ball again before it has touched another player an indirect free kick is awarded; if the thrower commits a handball offence:
     <li>a direct free kick is awarded;</li>
     <li>a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the thrower’s penalty area unless the ball was handled by the defending team’s goalkeeper in which case an indirect free kick is awarded; </li>
     <li>An opponent who unfairly distracts or impedes the thrower (including moving closer than 2 m (2 yds) to the place where the throw-in is to be taken) is cautioned for unsporting behaviour and if the throw-in has been taken an indirect free kick is awarded.</li>
  </ol>

For any other offence the throw-in is taken by a player of the opposing team.
</p>

											Here are some beginner tips to immediately level up your game performances:
                                                                                    <ol>
                                                                                        <li>Try to look up when you receive the ball as you will get better vision and to know what to do with the ball in that situation;</li>
                                                                                        <li>Try to practice shooting/passing with the inside core of your foot (this will be explained more thoroughly here). </li>
