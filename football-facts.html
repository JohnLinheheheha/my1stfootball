								<p> Footballs were traditionally made with a combination of hexagonal and pentagonal panels as they fit together like a puzzle to form a perfectly spherical shape which is why the hexagons and pentagons are equally important. The stitched-football has 32 panels of leather or synthetic plastic tightly stitched together. 20 of these panels are hexagons and 12 of them are pentagons. 								
                                                                </p>

										<h3>Football Pitches</h3>
									
									<p> Professional football pitches can vary in size quite significantly…According to FIFA and FA regulations, the dimensions of an 11-a-side football pitch must fall between being 100-130 yards (90-120m) long and 50-100 yards (45-90m) wide. Most Premier League football pitches measure 115 yards (105.16m) x 74 yards (67.67m). For example, Wembley Stadium’s pitch dimensions are 115 yards (105.16m) long by 75 yards (68.58m) wide, making it slightly narrower than the old Wembley’s measurements. Based on these measurements, you could fit 485 of our 20ft shipping containers on Wembley Stadium’s pitch…that’s a lot of storage…although there’d be no room for anyone to access the containers in the middle!
