									         The Premier League is one of the most prestigious leagues people could play in the UK. It consists of 20 teams battling to qualify for the next season, or even to win the Premier League Cup! Some teams will be relegated every season, and some could qualify for other leagues like the Europa Leagues, meaning there is fierce competition everywhere with no doubt. Each team is supposed to play 38 games, including both home and away games every season, but there are some exceptions under particular weather conditions or something else. Each season lasts from August to May.
                                                                                </p>

												<h3>  Historical Cool Things that Happened in the Premier League </h3>

Leicester City's 2015/16 Premier League title win was one of the greatest sporting stories of all time. The Foxes started the season as underdogs after almost being relegated the year before. But they lost just three league games to win English football's top title for the first time in their 132-year history. This is only a fragment of all the things that have happened in the Premier League.

They might have been away from the big time for a while, but Blackburn actually won the Premier League three years after it started. Ages before he was a regular in the Match of the Day studio, Alan Shearer was a goal machine who helped Rovers to become champion in 1994-95. The title chase went down to the last game of the season, but despite Rovers losing to Liverpool they edged out rivals Manchester United to win what manager Kenny Dalglish called a “Cinderella Story.”

With floppy hair and not a hint of designer stubble David Beckham looked more like his son Brooklyn on the opening day of the 1996/97 season. And he was certainly not the household name he would become. That started to change with one audacious swish of his right boot. Becks, then 21, was just inside his own half when he spotted Wimbledon keeper Neil Sullivan off his line and decided to have a go. It would be remembered as one of the Premier League’s most iconic strikes.

They said it was impossible – but Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal went an entire season without losing a single game as they lifted the title in 2003/04. The only other English team ever to do it was Preston in 1889!

Rewind to May 2012, and it’s the last day of the season. Manchester United have secured a win at Sunderland and look set to lift their 13th Premier League title. But Manchester City and QPR are still playing at The Etihad. A stoppage time equaliser by Dzeko puts City level and Utd fans get twitchy – but they are still two points clear. And then, with just moments left, Aguero scores a last-gasp 🏆 . The rest is Premier League history. For the first time in 44 years, City claimed the title in what would prove to be the start of a new era for the Manchester club.
